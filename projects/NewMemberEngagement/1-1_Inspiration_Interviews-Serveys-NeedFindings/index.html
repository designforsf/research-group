Noticing the difficulty for new members to navigate the weekly Hack Night workspace and identify a fitting project to work on, the UX Research group initiated a project to improve **new member engagement** in December 2015.
We adopted the approach of human-centered design, and focused on gaining insights by empathizing with new membersâ€™ frustrations at Code for SF (the inspiration phase), ideating lots of creative ideas (ideation), and designing prototypes and collecting feedback from new members before finally putting the solutions out at Code for SF Hack Night (implementation).

In the inspiration phase, we conducted both interviews and surveys with Code for SF new members to learn about their characteristics, aspirations, expectations, and frustrations at the Hack Night. We learned that the major needs for new member engagement fall into these categories:
Identifying a fitting project to contribute effectively
Approaching a project team easily
Finding opportunities to learn or practice a skill.  
 
We also interviewed other stakeholders -- including different project leads and a city government representative -- about their perspectives on new member engagement. We learned that they are particularly interested in engaging new members in a way that minimizes distractions at the weekly Hack Night and maximal productivity for the group.
