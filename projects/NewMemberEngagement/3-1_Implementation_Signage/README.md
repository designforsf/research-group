## Activities

1. Co-design sessions: signage sketches and dot voting
 * Door sign sketches (file DoorSign_Sketches_Photo_20160511) 
 * Floormap & agenda sketches (file FloormapAgendaSign_Sketches_Photo_20160511)
 * Dot voting notes on what participants like (file SketchesDotVotingNotes_20160511)
 * by Phoebe, Sandra, Uday, Jaoyi

2-1. Prototype design

 * Door sign designs (based on sketches) (file: DoorSign_Prototypes_20160525)
 * Floormap agenda sign prototype (file: FloormapAgendaSign_Prototypes_20160525 
 * by Phoebe, Sandra, Jaoyi

2-2. Prototype user testing

 * User testing plan (file UserTesting_Plan_Prototypes_20160525)
 * User testing audio recording (all audio files)

5. Signage implementation feedback
 * Qualitative survey designed by Caitlin (file: Qualitative_Survey_byCaitlin_20160511)
 * Qualitative behavioral observation by Jaoyi (file: ../PrototypeIterationNotes_20170210)
 * Quantitative measurements brainstorming session by Jaoyi, John-Michael, Deepthi (file: QuantitativeMeasurements_BrainstormPhoto_20160504) 
 * Quantitative behavioral scoring log by Jaoyi (file Quantitative_BehaviorScoringLog)
 * User feedback on V01-01 implementation by Jaoyi and Kevin (file UserFeedback_SignageImplementation_V01-01_20160817)
 * Front-desk Anthony feedback (file: Feedback_FrontDesk_Notes_20170113 )

The evolution and the rationale behind different versions of prototype implementations are documented in file PrototypeIterationNotes_20170210. 

## To-dos 
* The feedback collection process is in progress and needs UX practitioners to take it on.
