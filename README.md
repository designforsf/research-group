# Welcome to the UX Research Group!

The UX Research Group applies user-centered design, design thinking methods, and lots of post-it notes to improve C4SF projects and the Brigade experience.

## Our Mission

Our working group exists to promote learning and mutual improvement among its members, while also providing support and advisory services for project teams and the Brigade as a whole. 

We believe this group is important because it helps reinforce user-centered design principles that are essential for the delivery of effective digital products and services.

## What we do in the community

We are an active group, and at any time you will find us working on a project together.

+ **Consultations** with C4SF project leads in order to uncover user needs, refocus project efforts, and improve the user experience of apps.
+ **Workshop facilitations** to learn together about the underlying principles of user-centered design.
+ **Targeted studies** to address selected community and brigade-level issues and challenges.
